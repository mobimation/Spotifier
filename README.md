Music service access using Spotify API

This project is setup for learning and exploring use of the Spotify Player API and Web API.
Initially the app will allow searching for and displaying albums of an artist
where the user can play songs of the album and where there is an attempt to as faithfully 
as possible emulate the appearance of the official Spotify player as a skills training and demo.

This code is currently work in progress and may not represent a working app at
an instance when you happen to access it. This situation is in effect
as long as this README tells you so.

The next step planned once the above is in place is for tracks
where corresponding video exists to play that video 
in the UI background enhancing the musical experience.

The code makes use of the kaaes.spotify.webapi.android API for Web API access.
