# Spotifier
Music service access using Spotify API

This project is setup for practicing use of the Spotify Player API and Web API.
Initially the app will allowing searching for and displaying albums of an artist
where the user can play songs of the album and where there is an attempt to emulate
the appearance of the official Spotify player as a skills training and demo.
